# Introduction

In this unit we will focus on creating the environment we will use in future units to install the Oracle database server and clients, and perform all the tasks we will learn. We could use a real server, should we have one. But that is not likely the case, so it is better and less expensive to work with virtual machines.

Among all the possible options you can choose between the following two:

- VMs in VirtualBox
- VM in Microsoft Azure Cloud

If you decide to use VirtualBox, I will provide you the .ova files to create the virtual machines in your computer. If you decide to use Ms Azure, I will show you how to create the VM in Azure cloud. Each solution has advantages and disadvantages. The following table shows you some of them to help you take the decision:

| Item                              | VirtualBox | Azure                                              |
| --------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| PC Hard disk usage                | High       | Very low                                           |
| PC CPU requirement                | High       | Very low                                           |
| Network usage                     | Low        | High                                               |
| Use from different PC's           | Difficult  | Very easy                                          |
| Number of simultaneous running VM | Low        | Unlimited                                          |
| Velocity to create a VM           | Low        | Very High                                          |
| Usage charges                     | No         | Yes when Azure for students credit (100$) finished |
| Platform complexity | Low | High |
| Know how to use it to get a job | Medium | Very high |

As a conclusion I would say that if you don't have a very powerful PC, Azure would be your choice. In other cases, just decide considering which characteristics are more important to you: disk usage, mobility, learning new systems...
