# Functions of the database management system (DBMS).

The functions of the database management system (DBMS) are as follows:

- Data storage and retrieval: The DBMS is responsible for storing and retrieving data from the database. It provides a mechanism for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data.

- Concurrency control: The DBMS must ensure that multiple users can access the database at the same time without interfering with each other. To do this, the DBMS uses concurrency control techniques to ensure that each user can work with the data safely.

- Integrity control: The DBMS is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the data in the database. This means that the data must be accurate and consistent at all times. The DBMS must ensure that the data is not corrupted or becomes inaccurate due to system failures or human errors.

- Security control: The DBMS is responsible for ensuring that the data in the database is protected against unauthorized access. This includes user authentication, authorization of database access, and implementation of security policies.

# Components.

The components of a DBMS are as follows:

- Database engine: It is the core of the DBMS. It controls all database operations, including data storage and retrieval, concurrency control, integrity control, and security control.

- Query language: Allows users to perform queries and data manipulations in the database. Examples of query languages are SQL, PL/SQL, T-SQL, etc.

- User interface: Allows users to interact with the DBMS. It can be a graphical user interface (GUI), a command line, an API, etc.

- Administration tools: Allow database administrators to manage the database and perform tasks such as creating and modifying tables, assigning user permissions, performing backups, etc.

# Types.

There are different types of DBMS, among which are:

- Relational DBMS: Store data in relational tables and use SQL as query language. Examples of relational DBMS are Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, etc.

- NoSQL DBMS: Do not use relational tables to store data. Instead, they use non-relational data structures such as documents, graphs, or columns. Examples of NoSQL DBMS are MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, etc.

- Desktop DBMS: Are DBMS that run on a desktop or laptop computer. Examples of desktop DBMS are Microsoft Access, FileMaker Pro, etc.

- Cloud DBMS: Are DBMS that run in the cloud and are accessible over the Internet. Examples of cloud DBMS are Amazon RDS, Microsoft Azure SQL Database, Google Cloud SQL, etc.
